How would I improve the app?

1. State Management:

Problem: Prop drilling can lead to messy and hard-to-maintain code as the app grows.
Solution: Implement a state management library like RTK or Zustand.

2. Reusable Input Component:

Problem: Creating multiple input fields manually can lead to duplicated code.
Solution: Create a reusable input component.

3. Update ESLint Configuration.

4. Adding theme for colors etc.
